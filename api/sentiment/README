phpInsight - Sentiment Analysis in PHP
=========
---------

**v1.2**

phpInsight is a sentiment classifier. 
It uses a dictionary of words that are categorised as positive, negative or neutral and a naive bayes algorithm to calculate sentiment. 
To improve accuracy phpInsight removes 'noise' words.
